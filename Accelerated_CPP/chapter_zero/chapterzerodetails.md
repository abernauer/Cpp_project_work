# Program structure :
C++ programs are **free form**, meaning spaces are only required when they keep adjacent symbols from running together. New lines are treated as just another kind of space. Programs are normally indented to improve readability.

There are three entities which are not free-form:

+ string literals characters enclosed in double quotes; may not span lines
+ ``` #include name``` must appear on a line by themselves except for comments
+ ``` // comments``` // followed by anything; ends at the end of the current line

Multi line comments have the following form ``` /* */```.
