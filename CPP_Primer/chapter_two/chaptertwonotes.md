# Chapter 2 Variables and Basic Types

_Types_ determine the meaning of the data and operations in our programs.

```c++

i = i + j;

```

The meaning of the of even as simple a statement as above. Depends on the types of i and j. If i and j are Sales_item objects this statement adds the components of these two objects.


# 2.1 Primitive Built-in Types

C++ defines a set of primitive types that include the arithmetic types and a special type named *void* . The arithmetic types represent characters, integers, boolean values and floating-point numbers. The void type has no associateed values and can be used in only a few circumstances, most commonly as the return type for functions that do not return a value.
